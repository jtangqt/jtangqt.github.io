<h1>About the Archimedes Project</h1>
<p>A lack of clean water and adequate sanitation infrastructure is the largest problem that humanity faces today. 
These deficiencies result in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of development and the lives of millions 
of people every year due to diarrhea.</p>

<p>Archimedes Project works by leveraging existing technology, ideas from across sectors and experienced
partners to solve this large and difficult problem. In 2014, we launched our first enterprise ­ a clean water
social enterprise in Haiti. We act as a co­founder, working closely with a social entrepreneur to design
and launch a scalable enterprise that creates jobs while delivering affordable products or services across
an entire country or region.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The Archimedes Project's mission is to increase access to clean water and sanitation

around the world by working with locally competent and committed entrepreneurs to design and

launch lean, scalable and financially sustainable clean water & sanitation enterprises that leverage

existing technology, knowledge and partners.</p>
<p>
The Archimedes Project believes that world has the technology, ideas and expertise

necessary to get water and sanitation to the bottom billion and that these resources must

be used as leverage to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>
We are committed to bringing together groups of dreamers, thinkers, makers and doers

from across sectors to design and launch scalable and financially sustainable clean water

social enterprises.

<h2> What is a Social Enterprise? </h2>
<p> A social enterprise is a business for which a social mission and profit are inextricably linked. It makes

intentional positive social or environmental impacts by providing a product or service in the open market

and by using a sustainable business model.</p>
