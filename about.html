		<h1>About the Archimedes Project</h1>
		<p>A lack of clean water and adequate sanitation infrastructure is the largest problem that humanity faces today. These deficiencies result in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of development and the lives of millions of people every year due to diarrhea.
		<br>
		Archimedes Project works by leveraging existing technology, ideas from across sectors and experienced partners to solve this large and difficult problem. In 2014, we launched our first enterprise - a clean water social enterprise in Haiti. We act as a co-founder, working closely with a social entrepreneur to design and launch a scalable enterprise that creates jobs while delivering affordable products or services across an entire country or region.
		</p>

		<h1>Mission</h1>
		<p>The Archimedes Project's mission is to increase access to clean water and sanitation around the world by working with locally competent and committed entrepreneurs to design and launch lean, scalable and financially sustainable clean water and sanitation enterprises that leverage existing technology, knowledge and partners.
		<br>
		The Archimedes Project believes that world has the technology, ideas and expertise necessary to get water and sanitation to the bottom billion and that these resources must be used as leverage to solve this problem.
		<br>
		We are committed to bringing together groups of dreamers, thinkers, makers and doers from across sectors to design and launch scalable and financially sustainable clean water social enterprises.</p>
